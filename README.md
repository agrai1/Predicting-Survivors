# Predicting-Survivors
I predict survivors using logistic regression on the (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data "titanic") dataset from Kaggle.

I filled the missing age values by using the median value for individuals with the same sex and class. I also included a column for "adult males" ie individuals who were both male and above the age of 18. Finally, I dropped the cabin column.


The repository contains the Jupyter notebook I used in my analysis.
