# Predicting-Survivors
I predict survivors using logistic regression on the titanic dataset from Kaggle.

I filled the missing age values by using the median value for individuals with the same sex and class. I also included a column for "adult males" ie individuals who were both male and above the age of 18. Finally, I dropped the cabin column.

The Kaggle dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

The repository contains the Jupyter notebook I used in my analysis.
