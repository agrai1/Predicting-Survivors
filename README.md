# Predicting-Survivors

In this repository I illustrate my first foray into machine learning using the [titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle. This is a wellknown introductory dataset for those interested in data science and challenges the student to predict surivival on the Titanic. For my analysis I chose to logistic regression as the classifier and after data cleaning and feature selection wound up with an AUC score of 0.87. The repository contains the Jupyter notebook I used in my analysis.

Python libraries used:
1. Pandas
2. Seaborn
3. Matplotlib
4. Numpy
5. Scikit learn

Outline of Notebook:
1. Introduction
2. Summarizing the Data
3. Examining relationship with Outcome Variable
4. Cleaning data
5. Creating model
6. Evaluation model
7. Future directions
